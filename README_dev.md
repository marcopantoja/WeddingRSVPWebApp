# Wedding RSVP Web App

This project is a Google Apps Script-based RSVP system for a wedding website. It is composed of **three separate Web App forms**, each serving a unique purpose in collecting information from invitees. The apps are designed to run sequentially based on user input and backend validation of guest data via a Google Sheet.

## üìÅ Structure

- **PhoneVerification/** ‚Äî First step to validate access to the RSVP form.
- **GuestInfoQuery/** ‚Äî Collects attendance, dietary, and drink preferences per guest.
- **TravelInfoQuery/** ‚Äî Collects interest in group hotel and air travel.
